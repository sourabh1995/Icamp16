                The entire process of cracking the internship at Diffion was really thrilling. Joining them for a 2 months internship gave me a lot of exposure. 
                Moreover interning for a consultancy firm in digital marketing field kept me hooked on to the work I did. Lastly, to a certain extent this internship gave me an 
                edge over the others and helped me fetch a job in my dream company.

               I have attended internship camp organised by KIIT e-cell last year which had helped  me  to get an internship during my summer vacations. 
               I got selected in a company named Gain Waste Solutions Private  Ltd. which is a start-up based company established at IIT Kharagpur. 
               I have worked there under IIT Kharagpur Technological business incubation centre and have gained unfathomable knowledge working there with the other IITians. 
               I made it possible only because of KIIT e-cell which had built a platform for the students, start-ups and cooperates  so that everyone could get 
               proper exposure and networking and could fulfil their brighter future goals.

              Not just a paid internship, two months in Onergy solar was but a lot more than that. Starting from hands on experience with technicalities to getting to do

              My experience in the internship camp 2015 had been pretty awesome. It came to  my rescue when I was in search of a platform to showcase my skills. 
              The place where you need skills and not certificates to grab a chance to work in a field of your choice and explore limitless opportunities. 
              I cracked an interview and got an internship at Memilog, Hyderabad. It was the first time when I could try myself as a designer and work professionally and 
              feel the heat chasing deadlines. Hundred words are very less to describe an experience such a life changing experience. Go, try it yourself.
